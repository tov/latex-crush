The crush Package

To build the PDF documentation and style file, merely run

    % make

If you don't have make, it's possible to do it manually.  To create the
style file (crush.sty) and the documentation (crush.pdf), run the
following sequence of commands:

    latex crush.ins
    latex crush.dtx
    makeindex -s gind.ist crush.idx
    makeindex -s gglo.ist -o crush.gls crush.glo
    latex crush.dtx
    pdflatex crush.dtx

If you only want to build the style file, and not the documentation,
only the first command (latex crush.ins) is necessary.

The documentation is also available on the web at
