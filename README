The crush Package

SYNOPSIS

    This package provides macros that are useful when text or math needs
    to overlap or spill outside its enclosing box. For example, the
    \crushr macro sets its argument right-aligned in a 0 width box, so
    it spills out to the left.

    There is also a command \shrinkbox which equalizes the line lengths
    of its argument, including the last line. This is useful, for
    example, to make centered titles look good without resorting to
    manual line breaks.

BUILDING

    To build the PDF documentation and style file, merely run

        % make

    If you don't have make, it's possible to do it manually.  To create
    the style file (crush.sty) and the documentation (crush.pdf), run
    the following sequence of commands:

        latex crush.ins
        latex crush.dtx
        makeindex -s gind.ist crush.idx
        makeindex -s gglo.ist -o crush.gls crush.glo
        latex crush.dtx
        pdflatex crush.dtx

    If you only want to build the style file, and not the documentation,
    only the first command (latex crush.ins) is necessary.

    The documentation is also available on the web at
