# The `crush` Package

This package provides macros that are useful when text or math needs to
overlap or spill outside its enclosing box. For example, the `\crushr`
macro sets its argument right-aligned in a 0 width box, so it spills out
to the left.

There is also a command `\shrinkbox` which equalizes the line lengths of
its argument, including the last line. This is useful, for example, to
make centered titles look good without resorting to manual line breaks.
